    \rThe RUQ is the most sensitive region for free- fluid accumulation surrounding the liver and the right kidney, and in the hepatorenal recess, called Morrison's pouch. This view is also used to detect free fluid in between the pleural space on the right side. When viewing the Right Upper Quadrant, the probe indicator should be pointing cephalad on the patients right mid-axillary side.
    
    \rThese are the visible areas of focus:
    \r1) Hepatorenal Recess - Morrisons Pouch
    \r2) Inferior hepatic edge/inferior pole of kidney
    \r3) The diaphragm
    \r4) Pleural Space
    
    \rTechnique:
    \rProbe Indicator: Cephalad (points cranially).
    \rIn this view, the liver is easily seen. The diaphragm, slightly more difficult to identify. If you're unable to identify the diaphragm, have the patient take a breath or wait for inspiration as the diaphram should lower into view. Sometimes rib shadows can obstruct the view. Widely fan through the field and follow the lower edge of the liver down toward the posterior until you get a good view of the tip. If there's free fluid (jet black) in Morrison's pouch, it should be seen around the lower edge and tip of the liver.
    
    \rBelow you can see a full sweep of the RUQ. Notice the landmarks.

      \rThe LUQ a.k.a the perisplenic, or splenorenal view is used to visualize the presence of free-fluid surrounding the spleen (splenorenal recess a.k.a, Koller's pouch) and in left pleural space around the costophrenic angle. It's technically challenging and less sensitive for free-fluid than the RUQ due to the spleen being smaller to identify compared to the liver, the acoustic window being lessened due obstruction from the stomach and the clinician having to reach across the patient.
    
    \rThe traditional acoustic windows obtained in the LUQ are:
    \r1) Spenorenal Interface
    \r2) Inferior tip of the spleen
    \r3) The diaphragm, above and below
    \r4) Inferior Pole of the Left Kidney
    
    \rTechnique:
    \rProbe Indicator: More cephalad (points cranially) and posterior.
    \rStart midaxillary around the 8th ICS sweeping anterior to posterior until the splenorenal interface is identified. If there's difficulty visualizing the acoustic window, it maybe because the transducer is not posterior or superior enough. Once the spleen/kidney is located fan the probe in all directions to evaulate the area.
    
    \rIn a normal scan, the spleen and left kidney are tightly juxtaposed seperated by a hyperechoic line. The ecogenic line just cephalad to the spleen is the diaphargm. If there's free fluid accumilation, it's more likely to be found in the subphrenic space (between the spleen and diaphragm). Pleural effusions will appear as an anechoic (jet black) stripe or triangle just superior to the diaphragm.

    \rThe cardiac view is used to detect free fluid inside the pericardial sac. It can be separated into two separate views 1) Subxiphoid and 2) The parasternal long axis view (PLAX). As it's usually sufficient to evaluate one view to check for the presence of pericardial effusions, it's essential to learn both in the event one view is not easily obtained.
    
    \rThe traditional cardiac acoustic windows obtained are:
    \r1) Subxyphoid
    \r2) Parasternal Long Axis (PLAX)
    
    \rTechnique:
    \rProbe Indicator: Probe indicator points towards the left side of the patient.
    \rStart inferiorly to the xiphoid process and place the probe in the transverse axis parallel to the abdominal wall. Plunge the probe slightly under the ribs until the cardiac silhouette comes into view.
    
    \rIn a routine scan, the four chambers of the heart, and the pericardial sac should be visible. You should be able to appreciate these eight landmarks. 1) Liver, 2) RA, 3) LA, 4) Mitral Valve, 5) LV, 6) RV, 7) Ventricular septum and 8) Tricuspid valve.
