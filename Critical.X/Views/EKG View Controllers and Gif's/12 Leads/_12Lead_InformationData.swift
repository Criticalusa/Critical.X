        \rReading 12 lead EKG should be methodical, like reading chest x-rays. Below, we'll talk about the different morphology of the rhythm strips and how to assess each complex.
        \rIn a 12 lead EKG, there are 3 limb leads (bipolar), 3 augmented limb leads (unipolar) and 6 precordial leads (v1-v6).
        \rLimb Leads (Bipolar): Consist of leads I, II, and III. There are 2 electrodes (- and +) that are equidistant from the heart and the signal moves towards the + lead- producing a positive-upright deflection on the tracing.
        \rAugmented Limb Leads (Unipolar): This consist of aVR, aVL, and aVF. Ironically, these letters all mean something. the "a" = augmented. The "V" = voltage and the "R,L'F" = right arm, left arm and left  leg, respectively. These leads pick up electrical activity from the center of the heart towards the + lead - For example; aVR = center of the heart to the right arm etc..
        \rPrecordial Leads (V1-V6): Precordial refers to the area in the thorax in front of the heart. The letter "V" refers to unipolar and the corresponding number refers to the location on the precordium. V1 looks at the RV, V2 & V3: Ventricular Septum, V4: Apex of the heart, V5 & V6: Left Ventricle and lateral wall of the heart.
        \rAs in single lead EKGs, there are a few things that we should overall assess while
        looking at the tracing.
        \r 1. Is the atrial and ventricular rate regular?
        \r 2. Are there a P-wave for every QRS complex, and are there T waves?
        \r 3. Is the PR-Interval and QRS complex prolonged or wide?
        \r 4. T-wave morphology normal
        \r 5. Presence of any PVCs, PJCs, or PACs?
        \r 6. Examine the axis and determine where is the rhythm origionating from: Atrial, Ventricular, Junctional, Paced?
        \r 7. Make a differential interpretaion.
        \rMorphology assessment
        \rP-wave: The P-wave should always be positive and leads II, III, and aVF.  If not, then it should not be considered a sinus rhythm.  When looking at the precordial leads (V1 – V6), at times the P waves can be biphasic in V1 (which is negatively deflected) no more than 1 mm.
        \rPR Interval: The PR interval should be between 0.12 – 0.20 seconds in all of the leads. Any increase in the duration of the PR interval could suggest a heart block.  You can read more about the details of the different blocks in the EKG section.
        
        QRS complex: The QRS complex is
